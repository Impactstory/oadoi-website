    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        An oaDOI link is like a DOI, with a useful difference: if there's an open access version
        of the article, the oaDOI URL will send you there, instead of the paywalled article
        landing page. So for instance,

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This DOI links you a paywall page <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12373"><strong>doi.org</strong>/10.1038/nature12373</a>,</li>
        <li>but this oaDOI link gets you a PDF <a href="http://oadoi.org/10.1038/nature12373"><strong>oadoi.org</strong>/10.1038/nature12373</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The oaDOI system was inspired by <a href="http://doai.io/">DOAI.</a> It improves
        on their coverage, and offers
        <a href="/api">an API</a> with license information and other details. It's in
        <a href="https://github.com/Impactstory/oadoi">active development</a> by the

    <h2 id="data-source">Data Sources</h2>
    <div>
        We look for open copies of articles using the following data sources:
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> to see if it’s in their index of OA journals.</li>
            <li><a href="http://crossref.org/">CrossRef’s</a> license metadata field, to see if the publisher has reported an open license.</li>
            <li>Our own custom list DOI prefixes, to see if it's in a known preprint repository.</li>
            <li><a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, to see if it’s an open dataset.</li>
            <li>The wonderful <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE OA search engine</a> to see if there’s a Green OA copy of the article.
            BASE indexes 90mil+ open documents in 4000+ repositories by harvesting OAI-PMH metadata.</li>
            <li>Repository pages directly, in cases where BASE was unable to determine openness.</li>
            <li>Journal article pages directly, to see if there’s a free PDF link (this is great for detecting hybrid OA)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="errors">Fixing errors</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            We make a lot of errors. First of all, some open repositories are not yet
            <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/about_sources_date.php?menu=2&submenu=1">indexed by BASE</a>
            (which is where most of our Green OA information comes from). Then typos,
            dead links, and inconsistent formatting add up to create lots more chances to mix up
            connections between fulltext and DOIs.
            The good news is, we're getting better all the
            time, and your feedback helps.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you find errors, please let us know by
            <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kFZUUZUeM9ze9uXr2" target="_blank" >completing this form.</a>
             From there it'll go in our bug
            queue. We'll drop you a line when it's fixed.
