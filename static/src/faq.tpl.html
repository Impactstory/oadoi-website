        <dt id="data-sources">Where does your data come from?</dt>
        <dd>
            We use a number of different data sources to find open versions of articles
            (or in many cases, to determine that the articles are open already):
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> to see if it’s in their index of OA journals.</li>
                <li><a href="http://crossref.org/">CrossRef’s</a> license metadata field, to see if the publisher has reported an open license.</li>
                <li>Our own custom list DOI prefixes, to see if it's in a known preprint repository.</li>
                <li><a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, to see if it’s an open dataset.</li>
                <li>The wonderful <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE OA search engine</a> to see if there’s a Green OA copy of the article.
                BASE indexes 90mil+ open documents in 4000+ repositories by harvesting OAI-PMH metadata.</li>
                <li>Repository pages directly, in cases where BASE was unable to determine openness.</li>
                <li>Journal article pages directly, to see if there’s a free PDF link (this is great for detecting hybrid OA)</li>
            </ul>

        <dt id="creators">Who is behind oaDOI?</dt>
        <dd>
            We're <a href="http://impactstory.org/about">Impactstory,</a>
            a nonprofit working to make science more open and reusable online.

        </dd>

        <dt id="funding">How is oaDOI funded?</dt>
        <dd>
            Impactstory is supported by grants from <span class="funders">
            the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</span> We'll be supporting
            oaDOI as spinoff of existing projects for the next year, but we're looking for additional funding to expand the
            service even further. Possible models include grants and Service-Level Agreements with
            data users. No matter what funding models we end up with, the API will always remain free and open.
        </dd>

        <dt id="different-results-from-unpaywall">Why does the Unpaywall extension sometimes give different results from oaDOI?</dt>
        <dd>
            Our Unpaywall browser extension uses oaDOI to find fulltext whenever you run into paywalled articles.
            It supplements oaDOI with other data sources, too; for instance,
            Unpaywall tries to parse and understand scholarly article pages
            as you view them. Consequently,
             Unpaywall's results are a bit more comprehensive than what you'd get by calling oaDOI directly.
        </dd>

        <dt id="report-bugs">I found a bug</dt>
        <dd>
            Sorry about that! The problem may be that a given repository is not yet
            <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/about_sources_date.php?menu=2&submenu=1">indexed by BASE</a>
            (which is where most of our Green OA information comes from). Then there's also typos,
            dead links,  inconsistent formatting, and other gotchas.
            The good news is, we're getting better all the
            time, and your feedback helps. When you find errors, please let us know by
            <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kFZUUZUeM9ze9uXr2" target="_blank" >completing this form.</a>
             From there it'll go in our bug
            queue. We'll drop you a line when it's fixed.
        </dd>

            Stay tuned, we're still working on writing the answer to this question.
