    <h1>Service-Level Agreement</h1>
    <p>
        If you want to use oaDOI data to build or enhance your commercial
        service, you may appreciate our Service-Level Agreement (SLA).
        The exact SLA details will vary depending on your needs and budget, but
        the key benefits are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can download our whole database as a single file, and use it for
            commercial purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can get weekly updates on what changed in the oaDOI database. So, if you start
            with the download file, then subscribe to the weekly updates, you'll be able to
            maintain an exact copy of our database, on your own local servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            You'll get enterprise-level service and support established and guaranteed in writing.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Of course, if you don't need any of these features and have a moderate call volume
        (<100k/day), you'll be better served just hitting
        <a href="api">the API.</a>
        That's free
        to everyone for commercial and noncommercial use, and always will be.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our pricing on the SLA is flexible, depending on your revenue and use-case. So if you think
        the SLA might be useful, please <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">contact us</a>
        and we'd love to find a solution that works for you.
    </p>
