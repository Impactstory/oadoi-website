    <h1>API and dataset</h1>
    
    <p>
        There are two ways to get access to the oaDOI dataset: the API is the best bet for most
        uses because it's simple, fast, and easy to get running; the dataset is great for
        large-scale research and data mining.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we're
        dealing with 90 million articles, it takes a while to run a given version of our OA-detection
        algorithm across the
        entire dataset. This means that at any given time there are results from multiple versions
        of the algorithm
        co-existing in the database. You can generally ignore this, but for some research
        uses (including
        replicating our <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9l8rhrT_tMfsw6cqjOnW9GuxBh2b0OYqke1vAWw73g/edit#">recent study</a>),
        it's important to take into account. For any given DOI, you can check the
        <code>algorithm_version</code> key to see which algorithm generated the data we're reporting.
        (in the case of the study, we limited results to ones obtained from version 2 of the algorithm).
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're using the API or dataset, we recommend you subscribe to the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oadoi-users">mailing list</a> in order
        to stay up-to-date when there are changes or new features.
    </p>


    <h2>API</h2>

    <p>
        Our REST API gives anyone free, programmatic access to all of oaDOI's data.
        There's currently no rate limit, although if you need more than 100k calls/day you
        may want to download the dataset instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Requests must include your email, so that we can
        get in touch if something breaks, and so we can report usage to our funders.
        Add the email as a parameter at the end of the URL, like this:
        <code>?email=YOUR_EMAIL</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The API is very simple, and has just two endpoints. Both are read-only.
    </p>

    <div class="endpoint">
        <p>
        <code class="endpoint">GET /</code>

            gets information about the API.
            Returns a status object with version number. Try it here:
             <a href="https://api.oadoi.org">https://api.oadoi.org?email=test@example.com</a>
        </p>

    </div>


    <div class="endpoint">
        <p>
        <code class="endpoint">GET /:doi</code>
            gets data about a single DOI.  Try this example:
            <a href="https://api.oadoi.org/10.1038/nature12373">https://api.oadoi.org/10.1038/nature12373?email=test@example.com</a>
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2 id="dataset">Download the dataset</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset behind the oaDOI API is available for download as a big CSV file. It's free for use in
        non-commercial academic research.
        <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">Contact us</a> if you're interested in downloading it.

    </p>
    <p>
        If you'd like to download the dataset for commercial
        use, check out our
        <a href="sla">service-level agreement</a> program.

        The labels for data are the same whether you're looking at JSON keys in API, or
        column names in the dataset. Here are the labels, and some notes describing them.
        Note that there may also be other experimental keys/columns at any given time, so
        don't count on the number of keys remaining the same, and don't count on any
        keys remaining the same, other than the stable ones described below:
